    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- This project implements a text generation system using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) powered by GloVe word embeddings. The architecture leverages deep learning techniques to generate contextually relevant and coherent text sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Implementation\n",
    "- Core Architecture: Sequential RNN model built with Keras\n",
    "- Semantic Understanding: Integration of pre-trained GloVe embeddings\n",
    "- Dual Implementation: Both Keras and native TensorFlow versions for framework flexibility and performance comparison\n",
    "- Memory Management: LSTM/GRU layers for improved context retention\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development Goals\n",
    "- Enhance semantic coherence through GloVe embedding integration\n",
    "- Implement and optimize RNN architecture for text generation\n",
    "- Compare performance metrics between Keras and TensorFlow implementations\n",
    "- Analyze and tune hyperparameters for optimal text generation"
